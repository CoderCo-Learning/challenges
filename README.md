## [Challenge 1](./challenge1/README.md)

You're the new DevOps hire at a startup. They've given you a fresh Linux VM and asked you to build a production-ready Linux service setup for their Python app. But there’s no infra — you have to do it all.

Upcoming challenges in the next few weeks. Stay tuned!
