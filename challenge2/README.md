# Challenge 2 - The broken mysterybox

## Overview

You‚Äôve been given a mystery Linux server that was set up by a junior engineer who‚Äôs now disappeared. The system is half-working, misconfigured, insecure and undocumented.

Your job: Diagnose it, fix it, secure it and document everything.

This is not just about running commands‚Äîit‚Äôs about research, problem-solving and showing your problem-solving and troubleshooting skills in Linux. 

## Objective

- Get the system into a secure, production-ready state

- Restore broken services (NGINX, cron, systemd)

- Fix bad user permissions and SSH config

- Harden the system (UFW, fail2ban, services)

- Show your work clearly your repo. Explanations too

## Setup

Download the setup script and run it:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoderCo-Learning/challenges/main/challenge2/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

You can run this inside:

- Killercoda.
- A Multipass VM (Ubuntu 22.04)
- VirtualBox
- Or any local/cloud VM

This script intentionally breaks the system. You must fix it.


## Tasks

1. Fix NGINX

- Serve a web page on port 8080 (not 80)

- Index should say: Hello from DevOps!

- NGINX should start on boot

- Fix broken systemd override

2. SSH Hardening

- SSH must work only on port 2222
- Only admin and deployer users should be allowed
- Disable password login ‚Äî enable key-based auth
- Provide your public key for SSH

3. User & Permissions

- deployer user must:
  - SSH without password
  - Run sudo systemctl restart nginx
  - Read /var/log/* files
  - Add user to correct groups

4. Cron Logging

- Every 5 minutes, system should log uptime to /var/log/uptime.log
- Log must rotate weekly using logrotate

5. Secure the Box

- Enable and configure ufw
  - Allow only: port 2222, 8080, ICMP
- Configure fail2ban to protect SSH
- Disable unused services
- Set correct timezone to UTC

üö´ Rules

- ‚ùå No ChatGPT / AI tools allowed. Only as a last resort when you're stuck. 
- ‚úÖ You can and should Google, read man pages, official docs
- üì∑ Screenshots/logs in the repo to show your workings. 
- üîç Your steps should be reproducible and explain your thinking

Deliverables

Submit a public GitHub repo with:

1. README.md

- Step-by-step guide of how you debugged & fixed things
- What tools/logs/commands you used
- What you learned
- Screenshots of working result (curl, systemctl status, etc.)

2. Fixed files:

Any config files you had to create or fix (nginx.conf, systemd unit files, etc.)

3. Reflection (markdown file or in README):

- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn from first principles (not just copy-paste)?
- What would you do differently next time?

## Tips

- Use journalctl, systemctl status, nginx -t, sshd -T, ufw status, etc.
- Take your time. This challenge rewards effort over shortcuts

## Resources 

Here are some helpful, **non-AI resources** you should use during the challenge. Don‚Äôt rely on ChatGPT or AI ‚Äî treat this like real-world troubleshooting.
